# Adlayer javascript integration test
This is a small BDD style test suite, writen in Coffee Script (because this is more readable then javascript), and the source code lives on [github](https://github.com/adlayer/javascript-integration-test) and a live version can be found in [adlayerjavascriptsdk.com/integration-test/index.html](http://adlayerjavascriptsdk.com/integration-test/index.html)

# More tests
Soon we will add more tests

# Troubleshooting
Adlayer Javascript integration tests are writen guided by our [troubleshooting document](#)
